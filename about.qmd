Hi, thank you for visiting my blog! My name is Nora Elliott, and I’m a student at the University of Pennsylvania, set to graduate in May 2027. I’m majoring in Communications with a concentration in Data and Network Science, and I’m also minoring in Consumer Psychology and Nutrition. I plan to pursue a career in digital marketing, where I can combine my interests in media, behavior, and data driven strategy. This blog began as a project for a class I took on AI.

I came into this course without a specific goal beyond curiosity. But as I started writing for my blog, I began to realize AI is a tool that could help shape my future career in digital marketing. Around my fourth or fifth post, I realized that I could use this blog to explore how AI is actively transforming the marketing world, for everything from brand strategy, influencer campaigns to ad targeting and consumer psychology. So I pivoted. Posts like “Can AI Spot the Next Unicorn?”, “Does AI Know What You Want Before You Do?”, and “Built by a Bot” reflect that shift. I started asking harder questions: Can AI create a brand that people trust? Who’s responsible when automated advertising goes too far? Is AI a better judge of brand audience fit than a human marketer?

By combining what we learned in class with real world marketing scenarios, this blog became a testing ground for my career interests. I learned how to prompt more effectively, analyze AI outputs, and consider the ethical and creative implications of using these tools professionally. It taught me that the future of digital marketing isn’t just about creativity or data alone, it’s about how humans and AI can work together to tell compelling and responsible stories.

I hope you enjoy checking out my blog! I am always looking for new oppurtunities to learn or chat aout the spaces that interest me so if anything you read here peaks your curiosity don't hesitate to reach out to me
