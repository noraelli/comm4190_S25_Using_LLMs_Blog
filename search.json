    "section": "",
    "text": "What makes a joke funny? We all know the formula: set-up, punchline, timing. But does AI understand this formula? I‚Äôve spent plenty of time laughing at Memes and Tiktoks but could a machine do the same? So, for the sake of science (and good humor), I decided to put AI to the test and see if it could make me laugh.\nI asked our class LLM to generate jokes for me, and then I rates them on a scale of 1-10 for how funny they are\nI decided to start with a few classic joke styles: puns, one-liners, and dad jokes. AI seems to have a good grasp on these, but will they land the punchline? Here are some of the results:\n\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt skeletons fight each other? Because they don‚Äôt have the guts.‚Äù\nRating: 7/10 This one‚Äôs a classic. It hits the right balance of silly and clever. It‚Äôs a bit predictable, but I still laughed.\n\n‚ÄúI told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.‚Äù\nRating: 6/10 A little underwhelming. I see what AI was going for, but it didn‚Äôt quite have the punch I was hoping for. It‚Äôs a bit of a meh dad joke.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot.‚Äù\nRating: 3/10 I get that AI loves a good pun, but this one is just so bad. It really doesn‚Äôt work, AI, you tried, but this one‚Äôs a miss.\n\nNext, I thought I‚Äôd ask AI to come up with some observational humor, the kind that comments on everyday life or the weird stuff we as humans all know but never really talk about. I was curious to see if AI could pick up on little human relatable quirks like that.\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it funny how we can talk to Siri for hours, but when someone asks us to call someone, we freeze like we‚Äôve never made a phone call in our life?‚Äù\nRating: 6/10 Not bad, AI. It‚Äôs relatable, and I can definitely picture myself in that awkward moment where I forget how to dial a number. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking at all, or even really funny, but its relatable and I giggled.\n\n‚ÄúWhy is it that every time we want to be productive, we end up on Tiktok watching puppy videos? Is it the puppy videos, or are we just procrastinating in the most adorable way possible?‚Äù\nRating: 8/10 This one hit home as it is soooo true for me. I think we can all relate to wasting time watching cute animals when we should be working. Pretty good for an AI.\n\n‚ÄúWhy do we always pretend to be busy when we‚Äôre actually just staring at the wall?‚Äù\nRating: 4/10 Not funny at all, but I see the idea. It‚Äôs a good observation and an alarmingly human thing for an AI to know we often do, but the delivery could‚Äôve been stronger.\n\nI thought I‚Äôd push AI a little further and ask it for some darker humor. I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would handle this, but the results were interesting.\n\n‚ÄúI told my therapist I had a fear of commitment. She said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs schedule a session for next week, and we‚Äôll work on that.‚Äô‚Äù\nRating: 6/10 This one‚Äôs self-aware. It has the dark humor vibe, but I think it could use a little more edge to land better. Still, it‚Äôs got potential and is honestly better than I would expect.\n\n‚ÄúI once tried to run a marathon, but my body had other plans. Specifically, they were: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not doing this.‚Äô‚Äù\nRating: 8/10 This one‚Äôs clever! It taps into a relatable struggle‚Äîtrying and failing to do something ambitious and the delivery is good. Not sure it‚Äôs super dark but I liked it\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between a hipster and a graveyard? The graveyard has more life.‚Äù\nRating: 3/10 This one is just weird.\n\nAfter putting AI through its comedic paces, I‚Äôd say it can definitely be funny‚Äîsometimes. But there‚Äôs a noticeable difference between the humor of AI and the humor we get from human comedians. While both share a basic formula‚Äîset-up, punchline, timing‚Äîthe way AI and human comedians approach comedy is where things diverge.\nWhat makes human comedy jokes different from AI jokes?\nWhen it comes to human comedians, humor often comes with layers of personal experience, delivery, and a unique perspective on the world. Comedians like Dave Chappelle, Ali Wong, or John Mulaney have this uncanny ability to take everyday experiences and turn them into these deeply relatable, often profound, and always funny bits. Their timing is razor-sharp; they know how to pause, when to lean into a punchline, and how to give us just enough context to make the joke hit harder. It‚Äôs not just about the words‚Äîthey build tension, create expectations, and then surprise us.\nFor example, a classic Mulaney bit about being a kid is funny because of how he‚Äôs able to give such a detailed picture of a child‚Äôs brain, then tie that to a hilarious (yet completely believable) observation about growing up. The relatability, the self-deprecation, the storytelling‚Äîit all works together. The punchline isn‚Äôt just the final line; it‚Äôs the entire setup that takes us to an unexpected conclusion.\nAI‚Äôs humor, on the other hand, lacks that lived experience and human understanding of the world. Its jokes are more mechanical. It pulls from patterns in language and existing jokes, often replicating humor we‚Äôve already heard‚Äîpuns, dad jokes, and one-liners. There‚Äôs a clear pattern to AI‚Äôs jokes: it thrives on wordplay and simple observations. Take the skeleton joke from earlier: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt skeletons fight each other? Because they don‚Äôt have the guts.‚Äù The humor here is straightforward, but it‚Äôs almost too easy, too formulaic. The joke itself doesn‚Äôt come from a personal perspective or a twist on society‚Äîit‚Äôs based on a pun, which is an obvious play on words. It‚Äôs clever, but it doesn‚Äôt have the kind of depth or subtext that we get from human comics who inject their own experiences into their material.\nAI doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why certain jokes are funnier based on the context in which they‚Äôre told. A human comedian will know exactly how to build a joke based on the energy of the crowd, the way the night‚Äôs going, or even their own mood. AI just spits out a punchline because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs been trained to do. It doesn‚Äôt feel the rhythm or energy of humor‚Äîit just mimics.\nWhat makes AI jokes similar to human jokes?\nDespite the differences, there‚Äôs still something strikingly similar between AI-generated jokes and those from comedians. Both rely on patterns that people find universally funny: puns, exaggeration, and absurdity. A lot of humor is rooted in the unexpected, and AI can certainly tap into this, albeit in a more structured way. For example, the AI-generated joke about procrastination and cat videos hit the mark because it‚Äôs a universal observation: people get distracted by cute animals instead of doing important things. It works because it‚Äôs true. And while a comedian might add their own flair to it, AI is still able to capture the essence of what makes it relatable.\nIn a way, AI‚Äôs jokes are similar to those found in early stand-up routines where the jokes are more about general observations rather than personal stories. It‚Äôs a kind of humor that exists without the depth of a specific experience, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not funny. AI can capture the structure of humor pretty well, even if it doesn‚Äôt always understand the nuance.\nWhere does AI even get its ‚Äúsense‚Äù of humor?\nThis leads me to wonder: where does AI‚Äôs humor actually come from? Is it just a bunch of algorithms trained on massive datasets of jokes? Essentially, yes. AI learns humor by analyzing a huge pool of text‚Äîbooks, articles, websites, social media posts, and of course, jokes. It doesn‚Äôt truly ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù what makes something funny in the way humans do. It‚Äôs more like AI is a super advanced ‚Äúmimic‚Äù that‚Äôs incredibly good at picking up patterns and regurgitating them. The base of what is considered funny comes from human-created content, but AI doesn‚Äôt have the cultural context to make truly original humor.\nAI‚Äôs jokes are built on probability. It can take certain elements‚Äîword associations, cultural references, and the structure of well-established jokes‚Äîand piece them together. It doesn‚Äôt know how to innovate in the way a comedian can; it just knows what worked in the past. But as funny as that is, it‚Äôs also a limitation. Humor is often about breaking expectations or delivering a punchline with the right timing or cultural context. AI doesn‚Äôt yet have the ability to understand the subtleties of social or emotional context in the same way humans do.\nWhat surprised me about AI‚Äôs humor? What was AI better at than I expected?\nWhat really surprised me about AI, though, is how well it did at observational humor. The joke about procrastination and cat videos? I didn‚Äôt expect AI to pull that off. It actually captured a very human experience‚Äîsomething that feels universal. The fact that AI picked up on this everyday observation and turned it into a solid joke made me realize that while it‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs learning how to read situations and trends in a way that mirrors what makes humans laugh.\nIt also surprised me how quickly AI can generate jokes. While not every punchline lands perfectly, it‚Äôs able to process information and structure humor in real-time, something that would take a human comedian far more time to write, test, and refine. AI is a quick thinker, even if it lacks the depth to really make a joke feel alive.\n\nCan AI be funny? Yes, but in a different way than a human comedian. It can replicate basic humor patterns and structure jokes, but it doesn‚Äôt yet have the personal touch or nuanced understanding of why something is funny in a given context. The humor is still very much surface-level, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt make you smile. It‚Äôs a fun experiment, but for now, human comedians still have the edge when it comes to creativity, timing, and injecting the rich context that makes humor truly memorable.\nWould I trust AI to headline my comedy night? Probably not. But was it funnier than I expected? Yea it surprised me."
