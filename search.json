I decided to test out an AI-powered recipe generator to see what it could come up with based on the contents of my fridge. I inputted a list of common ingredients—leftover chicken, bell peppers, onions, spinach, and some pantry staples—and let the AI work its magic. Here are some of the dishes it suggested, and how I think they’d turn out:"

    "text": "AI vs. Human Chef\nA human chef’s creativity, experience, and ability to understand the nuances of flavor go far beyond what any AI could currently replicate. When a chef enters the kitchen, they rely on more than just a list of ingredients. They have the ability to sense balance—what flavors need to be adjusted, what textures will complement each other, or even how the dish might be presented to enhance the overall experience. A human chef might intuitively add a splash of lemon juice to brighten up a dish or adjust the seasoning based on how the ingredients come together while cooking. On the other hand, AI lacks this kind of sensory feedback. It doesn’t have taste buds, nor does it have years of experience fine-tuning recipes and techniques. It works by drawing from patterns in the data it’s been trained on—recipes from cookbooks, food blogs, cooking websites, and countless other sources. This means that while AI can come up with perfectly acceptable dishes based on what ingredients are available, it doesn’t understand how those dishes will feel once they’re put together. There’s no personal touch in its cooking, no instinct to elevate a dish by making a tiny change, like adding a pinch of a specific spice at the right moment.\n\n\n\n43ee1cafca2f947f0be0d94aeff0fc26-chef-cartoon-profession.png"

    "text": "What surprised me\nWhat surprised me most was how well the AI was able to suggest meals using basic ingredients. It didn’t just throw out a random combination, but instead, it took common recipe structures and applied them intelligently to the ingredients I had. For example, the stuffed bell peppers seemed like a creative take, and I honestly didn’t expect the AI to come up with such a thoughtful idea from what I gave it. It showed me that, while AI isn’t going to be a Michelin-starred chef anytime soon, it’s very capable of proposing ideas that work within the limitations of available ingredients. What’s more, I was also surprised by how well the AI captured the idea of creating balanced meals. It recognized that chicken, veggies, and cheese are often used together and suggested combinations that made sense. The dishes, while basic, didn’t seem off-putting or odd, which is impressive given the AI doesn’t actually “taste” the food. It uses its vast database of recipe knowledge to predict what flavors and ingredients tend to complement each other based on data rather than experience."

    "text": "Where does AI get its knowledge of what tastes good?\nAI’s knowledge comes from its massive training on a wide range of data—especially culinary resources like recipe websites, cookbooks, blogs, and reviews. It doesn’t have a direct understanding of taste like a chef does. Instead, it’s more of a data-processing system that identifies patterns. For example, it can learn that chicken and garlic often go together in Mediterranean cuisine or that spinach is frequently paired with cheese in pasta dishes. It’s pulling from what’s worked before, from both common dishes and the success of those dishes based on reviews and feedback, to make predictions about what will taste good. However, without the human element—those sensory moments when a chef adjusts their dish based on what’s in front of them—AI can’t truly “know” what would taste good beyond the parameters of established culinary patterns. The recipes it creates aren’t born from experimentation or the chef’s personal knowledge—they’re the result of statistical analysis of what’s most likely to work.\n\nThe AI-powered recipe generator was surprisingly capable of offering up simple, quick meals that were logical and would likely be enjoyable to eat, though they might lack the depth and creativity a human chef could bring to the table.\nIt can certainly be helpful when you’re in a rush, especially when you’re staring into your fridge and feeling uninspired. But, when it comes to really elevating flavors or taking a meal to the next level, a human chef’s touch, based on expertise and an understanding of how flavors develop, still holds the upper hand.\nAI’s ability to come up with functional meal ideas shows that it can be a useful kitchen assistant, especially for beginners or those who need to work with limited ingredients. However, when it comes to the magic of cooking and creating something memorable, that’s where a human chef still shines.\n\n\n\n360_F_416275833_h6zdOY2YqTq0VwAhmTvrANehceucH6xp.jpg\n\n\n\n\nWould I trust AI to cook me the most memorable meal of my life? Probably not. But it can for sure be helpful in everyday recipe planning!"

    "section": "“The Power of Imperfection: Why We Should Celebrate Flaws",
    "text": "“The Power of Imperfection: Why We Should Celebrate Flaws\n\nOpening:\nThe lights go down. A soft but confident voice fills the room.\n“Good evening, everyone. I’m here to talk about something we all share: our imperfections. The very thing that we often hide, avoid, or criticize. What if I told you that embracing imperfection could be the key to living a more fulfilling life? A life that’s not about perfection or flawless performance, but about being unapologetically human.”\nPause for effect.\n“Let’s start with a story—imagine you’re watching a movie, and you’re totally immersed in it. The actors, the plot, the setting—it’s all perfect. But at some point, you notice a tiny mistake: an actor’s line is a little off, a prop falls out of place, or the lighting shifts in a way it shouldn’t. Suddenly, the perfect movie loses its charm. The illusion is shattered. Why? Because we, as humans, are conditioned to seek authenticity, not perfection. Perfection feels staged, unnatural. And it’s the flaws in the story that make it real.”\nPause.\n“Now think about your own life. How often do you focus on the things that aren’t quite right? The small mistakes at work, the little missteps in conversations, the imperfections in your appearance? What if, instead of focusing on those flaws, you embraced them as part of who you are?”\n\n\nMiddle:\nThe tone shifts to a more reflective, encouraging tone.\n“We all strive for perfection—whether it’s in our careers, relationships, or even on social media. But why do we feel the need to be perfect? It’s the fear of judgment, of not being good enough. But guess what? Everyone else is just as imperfect as you. In fact, it’s our imperfections that connect us. They create vulnerability, which leads to empathy. It’s why we relate to characters in movies who stumble, or to a friend who shares their struggles. It’s the rawness, the authenticity, that makes them memorable.”\nPause.\n“Let’s talk about mistakes for a moment. We often see mistakes as setbacks, as things we need to fix or hide. But what if mistakes were a gift? A lesson in disguise? In fact, some of the world’s most famous innovations were the result of mistakes. Penicillin was discovered by accident. Post-it notes were invented because of a failed adhesive. The greatest discoveries often come from those moments when things don’t go according to plan.”\nShift in tone.\n“So, what if you started seeing your imperfections as strengths rather than weaknesses? What if you stopped apologizing for being ‘imperfect’ and instead celebrated those little things that make you… you?”\n\n\nClosing:\nThe voice becomes more hopeful, as if speaking directly to the audience.\n“Imagine a world where we stop hiding our flaws. Where we embrace the moments that don’t go perfectly. A world where imperfection is not something to be ashamed of, but something to be proud of. The next time you feel imperfect, remember that imperfection is what makes you human. It’s what connects you to others. It’s what makes you memorable. And, most importantly, it’s what makes life beautiful.”\nPause.\n“Thank you.”\n\n\n\nCould AI Hold the Audience’s Attention?\n\n\n\nai-robot-digital-machines-_10565321.png\n\n\nNot bad AI, it addresses a topic that’s relatable and introspective. The talk follows a logical structure, with a solid introduction, a well-supported middle, and a concluding message that encourages the audience to rethink how they view imperfection. But the big question remains: could an AI TED Talk hold the audience’s attention?\n\n\nWhat Worked:\n\nRelatable Topic:\nThe idea of embracing imperfection is universally relatable. It taps into something that everyone struggles with—whether it’s body image, career setbacks, or personal flaws. Everyone has felt that desire to be perfect at some point, so the theme resonates.\n\n\nPositive Message:\nThe theme of turning imperfections into strengths is uplifting. The talk encourages a shift in perspective, urging us to stop fearing mistakes and embrace the growth that comes from them. It’s a feel-good, motivational message that’s hard to dismiss.\n\n\nStructure:\nThe talk is well-organized and easy to follow. AI has a strong understanding of how to craft a speech, using hooks, transitions, and a clear conclusion. It’s a testament to how well AI can mimic human-style speechwriting.\n\n\n\nWhat Fell Short:\n\nLack of Personal Connection:\nWhile the topic is relatable, the AI doesn’t bring personal experience into the speech. A human TED speaker might share a personal story of overcoming their own perfectionism or failing in a big way and learning from it. This personal vulnerability helps build a connection with the audience. AI, on the other hand, can’t speak from experience. The talk remains informative but feels a bit impersonal.\n\n\nEmotional Depth:\nOne of the most powerful aspects of TED Talks is the emotional depth that human speakers bring. They inject passion, personal struggle, and authenticity into their words. AI, while capable of writing a coherent and logical speech, lacks the ability to truly embody emotion or vulnerability. It’s hard to get emotionally invested in a speech that’s generated by a machine.\n\n\nHumor and Timing:\nTED Talks often have moments of humor or wit that help break the tension and make the speaker more relatable. AI can create humor, but it doesn’t fully understand timing, delivery, or how to use humor in context. Without that nuanced touch, the speech might come off as more like a self-help article than a captivating live talk."

    "text": "The Purpose of a TED Talk:\n\n\n\nWhat-Is-A-TED-Talk_-Featured-Image-1.png\n\n\nA TED Talk’s primary purpose is to inspire, inform, and engage an audience by presenting new ideas or perspectives in a compelling and thought-provoking way. TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) is known for hosting speakers from various fields—science, art, psychology, business, and more—who present groundbreaking ideas, share personal stories, or offer insights into the human condition.\n\nSharing a Big Idea:\nTED speakers are often tasked with conveying an idea that challenges conventional thinking, inspires action, or presents a new way of understanding the world. It’s about sparking curiosity and leaving the audience with something to think about long after the talk is over.\n\n\nConnection through Storytelling:\nPersonal stories are central to TED Talks. By sharing real-life experiences or lessons learned, speakers build a deeper emotional connection with their audience. Storytelling makes complex ideas more relatable, easier to digest, and often more memorable.\n\n\nEngagement and Inspiration:\nTED Talks aren’t just about information. They’re designed to engage and inspire. The best TED speakers infuse energy, passion, and authenticity into their presentations, making the audience feel emotionally invested in the subject.\n\n\nActionable Takeaways:\nTED Talks aim to leave the audience with a clear, actionable takeaway—whether it’s a new way of thinking, a challenge to take on, or an opportunity to make a change in their own lives or work. The speaker should spark curiosity, but also guide the audience toward practical steps they can take to apply the new knowledge."

    "section": "Did AI Hit That Purpose?",
    "text": "Did AI Hit That Purpose?\n\n\n\ndownload.png\n\n\nWhen reviewing the AI-generated TED Talk script on “The Power of Imperfection,” it’s clear that the AI made a valiant attempt at meeting the purpose of a TED Talk, but there were areas where it fell short.\n\nSharing a Big Idea:\nThe concept of embracing imperfection is undeniably a big idea—one that resonates with many people in today’s culture of perfectionism, especially with the rise of social media and constant self-optimization. The AI script presents this idea clearly, offering a fresh perspective on how imperfections can actually be strengths. In this sense, AI did succeed in offering a new way of thinking about something that’s very relatable.\n\n\nConnection through Storytelling:\nThis is where AI misses the mark. While the speech was well-written and logical, it lacked a personal story. TED Talks are often memorable because of the personal, emotional connection a speaker can forge with their audience. A TED Talk about imperfection could have been much more impactful if the speaker had shared a personal failure or moment of vulnerability. It’s these stories that make ideas come alive. Without that personal touch, the talk feels somewhat like a lecture rather than a story-driven exploration of the theme.\n\n\nEngagement and Inspiration:\nWhile the AI script was motivational, it didn’t quite capture the emotional energy that a human TED speaker might bring. The best TED Talks often have a rhythm that builds and releases emotional tension—moments of humor, passion, or surprise that keep the audience on their toes. AI can generate an inspiring message, but it lacks the nuance and timing required to truly engage the audience emotionally. For example, AI can’t alter its tone or delivery based on how the audience is reacting. It writes a speech that would work in theory, but the delivery is left to chance, without the dynamic adjustments a human speaker would make.\n\n\nActionable Takeaways:\nThe AI speech does offer actionable takeaways by encouraging the audience to embrace their imperfections, see mistakes as opportunities, and stop striving for unattainable perfection. These are valuable insights that could have a lasting impact on the audience if delivered with more emotion. However, it’s missing the powerful call-to-action that might inspire immediate change—something a human speaker could add by tailoring the message to the specific audience they’re addressing. For example, a human speaker might challenge the audience to share a story about a personal failure or imperfection, leading to a more interactive and powerful conclusion."

The structure and content are solid, and the message is inspirational. However, where AI falls short is in the realm of human connection—the heart of what makes TED Talks so powerful. A key part of the TED Talk experience is the personal vulnerability and emotional energy that speakers bring to their presentation. AI, as impressive as it is at generating ideas and language, lacks the life experience, emotional depth, and interactive ability to truly engage an audience in the way a human speaker can.\nWhile the AI version might be informative and even thought-provoking, it doesn’t have the human qualities that make a TED Talk memorable. In short, AI can deliver the core message, but the magic that makes TED Talks so impactful comes from the storyteller—something AI can replicate but not fully capture.\n\nSo, while it’s clear AI has the technical ability to write a TED Talk, it doesn’t quite hit the full mark when it comes to achieving the emotional and relational purpose that TED is known for."

Companies like Nike, Apple, and McDonald’s have logos so recognizable that they transcend language and culture. But could artificial intelligence, with its algorithmic precision, create a logo that embodies a company’s identity just as effectively as a human designer?\nTo find out, I used AI logo generators to design logos for famous brands and then evaluated whether they matched the brand’s established identity. The challenge: AI doesn’t experience the world, doesn’t understand emotions, and lacks the cultural intuition that fuels great branding. Could it still capture what makes a company unique?\n\n\n\nI fed an AI logo generator the names of major brands—Nike, Starbucks, Apple, and McDonald’s—and let it generate logos based on keywords related to each company.

The question is—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-generated content can produce blog posts, social media updates, and ad copy almost instantly. It can analyze vast amounts of data, identify trends, and tailor messaging to specific audiences. However, authenticity is a major challenge. Take this example:\nAI-generated: “Unlock the future of finance with our revolutionary banking app—seamless, secure, and built for you!”\nHuman-created: “Tired of hidden fees and confusing banking? We built an app that puts you first—transparent, easy, and designed for real life.”\nThe AI-generated message sounds polished, but the human-written one feels genuine. Humans provide personality, humor, and emotional nuance in ways AI struggles to replicate.\nAI Strengths: Speed, efficiency, personalization at scale AI Weaknesses: Lacks emotional depth, struggles with nuance and cultural context\n\n\n\nA strong brand voice is more than just words, it’s about consistency and emotional connection. Humans understand cultural shifts, inside jokes, and subtle cues that shape brand personality. AI, on the other hand, relies on pre-existing data and patterns. For example, Wendy’s Twitter is famous for its witty, sarcastic tone. Could AI replicate it?\nWendy’s human-driven tweet: “When your friend says they love frozen beef but still wanna be friends. 😒”\nAI-generated version: “Fresh is better. Why settle for frozen beef when you can have quality? #BetterChoices”\nThe AI version is grammatically correct, but it lacks the humor and attitude that make Wendy’s voice so distinct.\nAI Strengths: Can maintain stylistic consistency based on training data AI Weaknesses: Struggles with humor, sarcasm, and real-time cultural references\n\n\n\nOne area where AI shines is in personalization. AI can analyze customer data to generate dynamic, personalized marketing messages at scale. Take this example of AI tailored email subject lines based on a user’s past purchases.\nHuman-written: “New arrivals you’ll love!” AI: “Hey Sarah, your favorite running shoes just got a new color!”\nAI excels at optimizing messaging for different audiences, ensuring relevancy and engagement.\nAI Strengths: Hyper-personalization, data-driven targeting AI Weaknesses: Lacks original creative insight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunnamed.png\n\n\nAI shouldn’t replace human marketers, rather it should enhance their work. Here’s how brands can incorporate AI effectively:\n\nUse AI for data-driven insights: Let AI analyze audience behavior, but let humans interpret it creatively.\nAutomate repetitive tasks: AI can draft first-pass content, while humans refine and personalize it.\nTest and optimize with AI: Use AI for A/B testing and predictive analytics to improve messaging.\nMaintain a human touch: Let AI suggest content, but ensure human oversight for authenticity and emotional impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunnamed.png\n\n\nNot entirely, but I’d use it as a tool. AI is a useful asset for efficiency, data-driven insights, and personalization, but it lacks the emotional intelligence and creative intuition of human marketers. The best approach is a hybrid model, where AI handles automation and insights while humans bring creativity, cultural awareness, and brand personality."

While AI follows a structured approach based on recognized patterns. It can suggest deep-breathing exercises when you say you’re anxious, but it won’t ask about your childhood or recognize patterns in the way a human therapist would.\nAI doesn’t understand emotional nuance. It can recognize words like “sad” or “stressed” but won’t fully grasp sarcasm, deep emotional pain, or the kind of comfort humans offer through shared experiences. A therapist might read body language, notice a change in tone, or offer a moment of silence—things that AI can’t replicate.\nThat said, AI still has a role to play. It can provide instant access to support when needed and help users build healthy mental habits. It may not replace therapists, but it can complement traditional therapy by offering tools for managing mental health between sessions."

    "section": "What makes human comedy jokes different from AI jokes?",
    "text": "What makes human comedy jokes different from AI jokes?\nWhen it comes to human comedians, humor often comes with layers of personal experience, delivery, and a unique perspective on the world. Comedians like Dave Chappelle, Ali Wong, or John Mulaney have this uncanny ability to take everyday experiences and turn them into these deeply relatable, often profound, and always funny bits. Their timing is razor-sharp; they know how to pause, when to lean into a punchline, and how to give us just enough context to make the joke hit harder. It’s not just about the words—they build tension, create expectations, and then surprise us.\nFor example, a classic Mulaney bit about being a kid is funny because of how he’s able to give such a detailed picture of a child’s brain, then tie that to a hilarious (yet completely believable) observation about growing up. The relatability, the self-deprecation, the storytelling—it all works together. The punchline isn’t just the final line; it’s the entire setup that takes us to an unexpected conclusion.\nAI’s humor, on the other hand, lacks that lived experience and human understanding of the world. Its jokes are more mechanical. It pulls from patterns in language and existing jokes, often replicating humor we’ve already heard—puns, dad jokes, and one-liners. There’s a clear pattern to AI’s jokes: it thrives on wordplay and simple observations. Take the skeleton joke from earlier: “Why don’t skeletons fight each other? Because they don’t have the guts.” The humor here is straightforward, but it’s almost too easy, too formulaic. The joke itself doesn’t come from a personal perspective or a twist on society—it’s based on a pun, which is an obvious play on words. It’s clever, but it doesn’t have the kind of depth or subtext that we get from human comics who inject their own experiences into their material.\nAI doesn’t seem to understand why certain jokes are funnier based on the context in which they’re told. A human comedian will know exactly how to build a joke based on the energy of the crowd, the way the night’s going, or even their own mood. AI just spits out a punchline because that’s what it’s been trained to do. It doesn’t feel the rhythm or energy of humor—it just mimics."

    "section": "What makes AI jokes similar to human jokes?",
    "text": "What makes AI jokes similar to human jokes?\n (The first ever AI powered stand up show)\nDespite the differences, there’s still something strikingly similar between AI-generated jokes and those from comedians. Both rely on patterns that people find universally funny: puns, exaggeration, and absurdity. A lot of humor is rooted in the unexpected, and AI can certainly tap into this, albeit in a more structured way. For example, the AI-generated joke about procrastination and cat videos hit the mark because it’s a universal observation: people get distracted by cute animals instead of doing important things. It works because it’s true. And while a comedian might add their own flair to it, AI is still able to capture the essence of what makes it relatable.\nIn a way, AI’s jokes are similar to those found in early stand-up routines where the jokes are more about general observations rather than personal stories. It’s a kind of humor that exists without the depth of a specific experience, but that doesn’t mean it’s not funny. AI can capture the structure of humor pretty well, even if it doesn’t always understand the nuance."

    "text": "Where does AI even get its “sense” of humor?\nThis leads me to wonder: where does AI’s humor actually come from? Is it just a bunch of algorithms trained on massive datasets of jokes? Essentially, yes. AI learns humor by analyzing a huge pool of text—books, articles, websites, social media posts, and of course, jokes. It doesn’t truly “understand” what makes something funny in the way humans do. It’s more like AI is a super advanced “mimic” that’s incredibly good at picking up patterns and regurgitating them. The base of what is considered funny comes from human-created content, but AI doesn’t have the cultural context to make truly original humor.\nAI’s jokes are built on probability. It can take certain elements—word associations, cultural references, and the structure of well-established jokes—and piece them together. It doesn’t know how to innovate in the way a comedian can; it just knows what worked in the past. But as funny as that is, it’s also a limitation. Humor is often about breaking expectations or delivering a punchline with the right timing or cultural context. AI doesn’t yet have the ability to understand the subtleties of social or emotional context in the same way humans do."

The joke about procrastination and cat videos? I didn’t expect AI to pull that off. It actually captured a very human experience—something that feels universal. The fact that AI picked up on this everyday observation and turned it into a solid joke made me realize that while it’s not perfect, it’s learning how to read situations and trends in a way that mirrors what makes humans laugh.\nIt also surprised me how quickly AI can generate jokes. While not every punchline lands perfectly, it’s able to process information and structure humor in real-time, something that would take a human comedian far more time to write, test, and refine. AI is a quick thinker, even if it lacks the depth to really make a joke feel alive.\n\n\nCan AI be funny? Yes, but in a different way than a human comedian.\nIt can replicate basic humor patterns and structure jokes, but it doesn’t yet have the personal touch or nuanced understanding of why something is funny in a given context. The humor is still very much surface-level, but that doesn’t mean it can’t make you smile. It’s a fun experiment, but for now, human comedians still have the edge when it comes to creativity, timing, and injecting the rich context that makes humor truly memorable.\nWould I trust AI to headline my comedy night? Probably not. But was it funnier than I expected? Yea it surprised me."
